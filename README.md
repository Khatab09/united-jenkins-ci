 **In this project, i performed smoke test, sanity test, and regression tests using Selenium Java. i used BDD framework with cucumber and TestNG, followeing the page object model**.
 **In BDD frame work i have feature file which is where writing my test cases by using gherkin language ,its easy to understand for technical and non technical person **.

 <br />
 Writing our test cases with Gerkin language in cucmber feature files increse the redability, and reusability.<br />
Writing our test cases with Gerkin language in cucumber feature files increases the readability and reusability.<br />

 1-Page object model  helped us to better organize our web elements and the corresponding pages.
 
2- once again increased the readability.

3-reduces the code duplication, and improves test maintenance.
